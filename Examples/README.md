# Examples

This sub-directory contains Pluto notebooks.  It is independent of the rest of the package directory
tree in the sense that the notebooks load the package `DOT_RydSim` from the package registry
`DOT_JuliaPackageRegistry` at
`[github.com/dojt/DOT_JuliaPackageRegistry](https://github.com/dojt/DOT_JuliaPackageRegistry.git)`.

In particular, **changes in the package directory tree that have not been updated to the package
registry are not seen from within the Pluto notebooks!**
